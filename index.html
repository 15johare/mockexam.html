     <h2>this is information on a llamaa</h2>
     
     <p>The llama is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 m tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg.</p>
     <p>They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd. The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5â€“8 miles)</p>
     <p>Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about 40 million years ago.</p>
     <p>They migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange.</p>
     <p>By the end of the last ice age camelids were extinct in North America.</p>
     <p> As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada.</p>
